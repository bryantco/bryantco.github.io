Hi there! I am a Research Analyst at the University of Chicago Crime Lab and Education Lab. I am broadly interested in education policy and applying causal inference & computational methods to study questions relating to educational equity and student well-being.

I previously received my M.P.P. from the University of Chicago, with a <a href="https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/degrees/ma-public-policy-certificate-research-methods-macrm/program-overview" target="_blank">Certificate in Research Methods</a>. I also hold a B.S. in Economics/Mathematics and a B.A. in International Relations from the University of Southern California. <br>

Outside of school, I enjoy training for triathlons and spending time with my corgi, Misu.
