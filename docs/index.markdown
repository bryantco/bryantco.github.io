Hi there! I am a current <a href="https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/degrees/ma-public-policy-certificate-research-methods-macrm/program-overview" target="_blank">M.A. in Public Policy, Certificate in Research Methods (MACRM)</a> student at the University of Chicago. I am interested in using applied microeconomics & econometrics to tackle questions in economic inequality, development economics, and political economy. <br> <br>
I previously received my B.S. in Economics/Mathematics and B.A. in International Relations from the University of Southern California. <br> <br>

Outside of school, I enjoy training with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UChicagoTri/" target="_blank">University of Chicago triathlon club</a> and spending time with my corgi, Misu.
