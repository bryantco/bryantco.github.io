In China, high school students seeking admission to domestic universities face the daunting
task of taking national college entrance examinations known as the *gaokao* (高考) at the end of their third years. Similar to the United States, there is significant heterogeneity in the location and quality of universities that *gaokao* students end up in. Using <a href="http://gklq.ntzx.cn/index.asp?jlh=4">*gaokao* results data</a> from Nantong High School (南通中学), a relatively selective high school in Jiangsu province, I present three maps that try to unpack some of this heterogeneity. These maps display the 138 different universities that the 855 *gaokao* examinees from Nantong High School in 2015 ultimately chose to attend. <br> <br>

The first map below simply displays bubbles corresponding to the geographical locations of universities that students end up in. Each bubble corresponds to a single university; bubble sizes correspond to the number of graduating students attending that university. I argue that there are two major takeaways:


* **Most students choose to attend universities in major cities** (plotted in semi-transparent gray on the map). This can be seen in the large overlap between the purple bubbles and the points corresponding to cities. This is a slight difference from the United States, where prestigious universities may not necessarily be located in large metropolitan areas.

* **Most students choose to stay in their home province of Jiangsu, and/or home city of Nantong.** This makes sense especially in Jiangsu, since major cities such as Shanghai (上海) and Nanjing (南京) are home to many universities (including very prestigious ones).

The previous map is slightly misleading due to the purple bubbles having high overlap within a city (eg in Beijing 北京 and Wuhan 武汉). A map that displays variation in the number of students attending colleges across the different provinces would solve this problem, as presented next.

This map adds two more layers to the story:


* **This high school seems to have strong university placement**. From the 855 students, there is a strong concentration of students who end up in Shanghai, Hubei, and Beijing. These locations are home to some of the best universities in China, such as Shanghai Jiaotong University (上海交通大学), Wuhan University (武汉大学), and Peking University (北京大学 or 北大 for short).

* **There are provinces where no students chose to attend university in.** These seem to be mainly in the interior of China. Although I haven't explored the data, these provinces appear to be *poorer* and/or *ethnic minority* provinces relative to Jiangsu.
