In China, high school students seeking admission to domestic universities face the daunting
task of taking national college entrance examinations known as the *gaokao* (高考) at the end of their third years. Similar to the United States, there is significant heterogeneity in the location and quality of universities that *gaokao* students end up in. Using <a href="http://gklq.ntzx.cn/index.asp?jlh=4">*gaokao* results data</a> from Nantong High School ()南通中学), a relatively selective high school in Jiangsu province, I present three maps that try to unpack some of this heterogeneity. <br> <br>

The first map below simply displays bubbles corresponding to the geographical locations of universities that students end up in. Each bubble corresponds to a single university; bubble sizes correspond to the number of graduating students attending that university. I argue that there are two major takeaways:


* Most students choose to attend universities in major cities (plotted in semi-transparent gray on the map). This can be seen in the large overlap between the purple bubbles and the points corresponding to cities. This is a slight difference from the United States, where prestigious universities may not necessarily be located in large metropolitan areas.
* Most students choose to stay in their home province of Jiangsu, and/or home city of Nantong. This makes sense especially in Jiangsu, since major cities such as Shanghai (上海) and Nanjing (南京) are home to many universities (including very prestigious ones).
